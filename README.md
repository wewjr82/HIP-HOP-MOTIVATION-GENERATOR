<h2>How It's Made:</h2>


<p>Tech used: HTML5, CSS3, & Javascript</p>

<p>I created the web-based application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display motivational messages in the style of hip hop music. The application is designed to help users stay motivated and inspired, and it can be accessed from any device with an internet connection.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>I learned it's important to break down large tasks into smaller ones. Creating a web application can be a daunting task, but it's helpful to break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. This will make the process seem less overwhelming and will help you to stay focused.</p>
